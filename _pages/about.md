Hi 👋 I'm Jay !! \
Welcome to my GitHub Blog

I'm a DevOps Engineer 🧑‍💻 . \
And mainly worked by managing the servers. \
So I'm familiar with using Linux Commands, and among the languages, use C well. \
I'm actively looking for a job 😄

I want to stay in Toronto as long as possible from March 2023 !!
