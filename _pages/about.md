Hi 👋 I'm Jay !! \
Welcome to my GitHub Blog

I want to become a DevOps Engineer 🧑‍💻 . \
I mainly work on managing servers. \
So, I'm familiar with using Linux Commands, and have experience with C programming. \
I'm currently studying at Humber College with a major in Computer Systems Technician. \
I'm actively looking for opportunities to grow in this field 😄
